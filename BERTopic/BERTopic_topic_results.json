      "Too many EDITS comments to reply to individually you people ARE BENT if you think Bryson and team would lower themselves to the point of editing out bad shots and allowing rehits Its not like Trump didnt hit some bad shots but only a handful sure they DOWNPLAYED his bad shots but they DID NOT edit them out Bryson respects the game of golf too much to CHEAT Look at the DIVOTS during the video theres ZERO evidence of extra divotsshots Just look at virtually all the shots Trump hit from and in Which includes most of the par s hes out there walking after DARTS like a freaking boss you dont hit those kinds of shots if youre the type that needs as bad as that putting stroke LOOKS Trump HOLED or had a guaranteed two putt all but two of the greens And maybe he two putts the man if you want but you only make yourselves look like complete IDIOTS by screaming at whats right in front of your faces",
      "Not sure which post youre referring to so I may be repeating but the specific reason Bryson chose the red tees was to have a good chance to shoot and he has a good chance to shoot just using his own ball from the reds with his incredible length If you check his other videos he played the same type of challenge with Sergio Garcia from the white tees at a course and didnt hit so with an amateur no matter how good is not possible It was a hilarious moment when after one of Bryson yard bombs Sergio comments that he should just pick up his ball and not bother hitting a tee shot because theres no way Sergio was going to come close to Brysons tee shot Another Bryson video I recommend is where he plays a challenge with a set of walmart junior clubs Driver irons putter and shoots under in holes His ability is off the charts",
      "That was SO COOL How could you not like both of these guys So genuine So true to their character and so much fun to watch Thank you for making this happen and I wish everyone could appreciate Trump for who he is and not based on who the media makes him out to be My only disappointment was Trumps Patrick Reed comment Reed seems like kind of a doosh And a little dishonest Accused of cheating a couple times by his peers But I think Trump just likes Reeds mental toughness and I cant disagree with that Although he has fallen off a bit like most of the LIV guys Im sorry but playing easier courses in easier conditions in three days instead of four with no cut and a side prize chance makes these guys lose their edge JUST enough to make the difference in the majors We couldnt tell right away but I believe strongly that you can see the LIV effect over time now that these guys have played in said conditions over a couple year period Aside from Bryson everyone else has fallen off Koepka cant seem to stay sharp long enough to win right now Rahm has fallen off big time And Phil isnt taking golf seriously at all anymore which is my personal biggest disappointment Phil should have been the first age player to compete often and win occasionally but that was before he took the money and ran But I dont blame him at all He was right about the PGA Tour being greedy and he deserves all the money and laid back golf he wants Anyway Bryson is a good dude and great player And Trump actually is a REALLY good golfer like he said he was Definitely proved me wrong"

      "Trump was lying about his club championships Trump claims to have won club championships that he didnt play in and was actually in a different city the days of the tournament Trump calls into the GM and club pro at his club and asked what the winning score was And then Trump say he shot that score earlier in the week or maybe at a different golf course some other week and that he should be the winner because he had the lowest score And surprise the GM and club pro have his name engraved on the trophy Trump is probably around an handicap which is a perfectly respectful handicap but his shortness off the tee which translates to shortness on every other club he hits and mediocre short game again perfectly adequate for a mid double digit handicapper so he would get beat by probably shots in a round from the blue tees FYI handicaps are not age based only score based",
      "Obviously you have never played a real round of golf Miniature golf does not count although based on Trumps putting stroke he wouldnt be very good at that either Did you know Trump has won club championships when he didnt even play in them He calls in to the GM and head golf pro at the course he owns and tells them that he played a different course the previous week or maybe hell play next week but for sure he would have beat the winning score And sure enough his name goes on the winners a man of his age and obesity Trump is actually a very good handicap golfer He could probably beat a bunch of hackers at the local golf course",
      "Interestingly enough back in and when Trump was years old so a lot younger not even a senior by some criteria a lot thinner a lot better in shape he played in the American Century Championship for celebrities in Lake Tahoe Maybe youve seen this on national TV He averaged for rounds one year then for rounds the next year and then stopped playing I remember at the time he claimed to be a scratch golfer scratch is usually defined as a handicap or better a as opposed to a which is a stroke difference Actually those scores are the minimum he could have scored because the actual tournament used a modified stableford scoring system so once you scored a double bogey player just picked up since it scored the same as any higher score So averaging could have been or Good players dont get better when they reach their s and nobody who has played with Trump has described him as a low handicap golfer Many have described him as a I prove Trump submits false scores Since I have never played with him and never will probably not Ill rely on people who have played with him who say hes decent not good and decent is not close to a handicap"

      "I will tell you when you are lying Pretty much all of it and they do it so that imbeciles can make statements like these But I am tired of go over your BS shall weIm gonna paste your comment here too I have a habit of making people delete defending claims made in a post that are factually accurate Meanwhile you are defending a twice impeached four times indicted times over convicted felon who is a fraud and a civilly liable rword In this scenario Ill support the guy who may need a daily nap of the youve done is state your opinions assumptions and feelings while Im stating facts Tell me when Im telling First impeachmentDonald Trump was accused of leveraging US aid to Ukraine in exchange for dirt on the Bidens First of all Biden actually did this He bragged about it on camera He forced the Ukraine government to fire a prosecutor that was investigating and in the midst of making arrests and seizing property his sons crooked conglomerate benefactor A no show board seat he admittedly only had because of his name connection to his father On the other hand this is the very DIRT that already existed and was being reported on that DJT asked about in his phone call There was no mention of withholding of aid in exchange No threats no ultimatums And people were making hay about him asking him to contact his attorney This is not strange at all since Clinton signed a treaty with Ukraine to fight corruption and cooperate in all criminal matters Including the Bidens who have sold influence as a business to nearly every scumbag despot nation on Earth for nd impeachmentThis one is ridiculous on his face as it is impossible to impeach someone who is not currently in office But the rabid democrats thought maybe they could prevent him from seeking office again But the FACTS are A Donald Trump began signing the documents and beginning the procedures to hand over military control in NOVEMBER He has every right and DUTY to continue to fight in court for what he and at least million Americans believe was a rigged elekshun it was apparently They changed the state rules manipulated media etc That no courts or state legislatures put their foot down for fear of riots or worse is irrelevant B Donald Trump offered at a minimum National Guard troops to protect the Capitol on J What sort of insurrectionist supplies his enemies with troops It was Donald Trump who brought up the security concerns in a joint military meeting as attested by several attendants It is a governor of a state and in this case for the Speaker of the House by extension the Capitol Police chief and the Mayor of that must approve a national military action for security within their border This was denied in writing by Nancy and the Chief the latter whom changed her mind the day before but was rebuffed by Nancy Wouldnt you know the same Nancy Pelosi who appointed the select committee to investigate Selecting two rabid antiTrump Republicans to say it was bipartisan not allowed to investigate the person with the most responsibility Nancy herself and furthermore suppressing vital exculpatory evidence and totally ignoring the FBIs covert involvement in the event Oh and her daughter an amateur documentary filmmaker happened to be at the Capitol with a film crew C Donald Trump never said anything other than protest peacefully told his supporters that the police were our friends and were to be respected and was never charge with insurrection What he was impeached Four times indicted means nothing Innocent until proven guilty is how we do it here or else admit that you support a corrupt justice times over convicted felonSir do you know Jack Smiths record Its horrible and I think you should go study He holds a rare distinction of having another smear case overturned unanimously by the Supreme Court And has had other cases where he egregiously manipulated evidence I am surprised he still has a law license but of course hes a Democrat Anyway this crime was writing attorney fee in a check register while wouldnt you know it paying a lawyer A lawyer that mortgaged his owned house lied to his wife lied to everyone about to pay off an accuser of Donald Trump to keep quiet which she didnt end up doing anyway and lost her case dealing with the broken NDA and owes Trump the initial payment and court costs around k All so that he could gain favor and position in a future Trump White House He told several people of these aspirations And it is noteworthy that just about everyone who had to deal with the guy hated to do so because he was a loud brash and rude climber and schemer Convicted of tax evasion finance violations and certainly also guilty of perjury To this day Donald Trump maintains that he never slept with Stormy Daniels Something she herself denied for years until he ran for president remember that he was already a billionaire He also was unaware that this Cohen was paying her for him But being the magnanimous person that he is he reimbursed the man and paid him handsomely for his other services legal services you know the kind he wrote in his records And just to get rid of the the case if he was guilty of this NY state misdemeanor falsifying business records A k fine But the statute of limitations passed years prior No problem this is Trump were talking about here Well just connect it somehow to a campaign finance violations and poof no statute Now well take every single scrap of paper or copy thereof and make each one a separate charge Now in this case the jury was selected from a D voting population thats fair The defendant was gagged at threat of imprisonment for a paper crime while the STAR WITNESS for the prosecution on whos tainted credibility hung the whole case was free to blab his fat mouth whatever crap he could think of all over social the jury instructions one of the most blatant middle fingers to justice in the US in history allowed the jurors to not only not be required to NAME the crime which made this misdemeanor into felonies they didnt even have to AGREE on which one each juror FELT may have been violated including unnamed random federal tax law And note that tax experts were denied testimony by the judge which may have at least informed the jury on what the law just the tip of the problems with this miscarriage of justice if you dont see them you are dishonest and patently unobjective This case will be overturned Everyone and their brother knows its a political hitjob And its absolutely disgusting what the Democrats will use to go after their opponents They have zero respect for the law just like they had zero respect for any congressional committee pretty much all of them they used in attacking Donald Trump while they held the Civilly liable rwordThis may be the easiest Let me first ask you what words might you have for a woman to falsely accuse you of such a horrible crime Thats why he had to pay her million dollars for trash talking that person I will defend anything he ever said about her By the way did you know she only sued for million Thats not lets talk about the accusations Its notable you have to say civilly Oops thats because he was ACQUITTED of that charge But that means nothing to you people Did you know when this crazy lady first made her accusations in the New Yorker mag she was sure it was She wore the dress on the cover and it said this is the dress I was wearing when Trump red me She said she had never worn it again since that day and it had hung in her closet One problem with that the magazine had to point out to her that very distinct designer dress WASNT SOLD ANYWHERE in WhoopsThen theres the Anderson Cooper interview where she blatantly emphatically states this was NOT SEXUAL And she IS NOT A VICTIM And that I think most people think of re as sexy think of the is a liar a lunatic and whomever believes her BS after doing even a little research is not an objective honest way you lunatics treat this man is despicable Its actually really sad that you are so brainwashed as to vote against your own best interest because you believe this crap I could just as easily debunk Russia collusion pee tapes fine people on both sides mocking a disabled reporter for being disabled suckers and losers and a myriad of other baseless disgusting nation damaging attacks you people throw at and Biden being a handicap is an absolute joke My amateur year old could take him"
